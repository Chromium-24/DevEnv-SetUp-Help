Undoing stuff on GIT
Source video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBLjB7PZoK0#t=3.375194
========================================================================
Notes taken from video - not all of these commands have been tested yet 

Edited file in local directory, saved file, did not add/commit on GIT yet - how to fix it?
$ git checkout -- myfile.txt
$ git checkout -- myDirectory
  - the "--" is current branch (in this case Master), and file we want is specified next
  - this one command checks out the file from repository and replaces working directory file with it
  - works on directories too as shown in above syntax

File was staged (added to be committed) but now we want to edit it again:
$ git reset HEAD file.txt
  - do git status and it will tell us this syntax
  - this will unstage file.txt and reset the head so it is not on this commit

$ git reset
  - will reset everything and let us add and commit again (which is often simpler)

$ git commit --ammend -m "my comment"
$ git commit --ammend
  - w/ comment - this ammends the comment on last commit as well as adding new changes to it
  - just adds new changes to last commit
  - can only affect last commit (most recent one) before we push

$ tbd ...
