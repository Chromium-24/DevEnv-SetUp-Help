$ ls -la
  - list files

$ git init
  - builds .git folder and initiates tracking for git
  - do this from the folder you want to initialize

$ git init my_project
  - will build the subfolder and initialize it

$ git rm -rf .git
  - removes .git folder and effectively stops tracking this code folder (reverses git init)

$ git status
  - check what is in project and at this stage is untracked
  - can use this command at any time for status of project before executing commands

$ touch .gitignore
  - touch creates a blank text file using name specified
  - .gitignore is used to build a list of files to ignore (edit manually to add files to ignore)
  - .gitignore can take wild card arguments like:  myPattern*.*
  - if using paths to a file, use "/" as in:  myfolder/myfile.txt
  
$ git remote add origin <url to remote project>
  - add local project to remote repository (at URL provided)
  
$ git remote
  - shows all remotes hooked up to this local project (will say "origin" right after previous command)

$ git push -u origin master
  - use -u switch first time only to get content pushed up to new remote repository
  - may be prompted for password to remote repository (or login popup may occur)
  
Then - should be able to use same add, commit, push commands as in lesson 1 once all is set up
