Pre-requisites:
-----------------------
1) Donwload / Install Github Desktop
2) Setup a new project on Github
   - project should be created with README.MD with some basic idea of what you are creating documented in it
   
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Setting up Project to work Locally (assumes building new project in empty local folder)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Warning! - in this process you will clone the starter project from Github.
Do not edit in both places (online and local) after cloning or problems will result.

This walkthrough includes creation of project by cloning, editing adding files locally, sending back to Git,
and finally, editing Readme.md on Git and synching that update to your local copy so work can continue later.

In the content that follows, "$" represents the prompt, type commands after the "$" as in:
$ git
All you type is "git" to get a list of all git commands

From Github Desktop, use these commands:
$ cd "root folder for your git project"
  - note:  on windows, choose a working location that is not too deep.  If paths get 260 characters long they may fail
$ git clone <URL to clone from project you created on Github>

Your project should now be ready to use.
