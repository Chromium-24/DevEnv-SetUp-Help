# DevEnv-SetUp-Help

This project includes experiments and write-ups from attempts to set up developer environments and software.  The intent
is that this content may be useful to others as they attempt to figure out how to set up their own environments and software,
but it is not comprehensive and is presented as is.  Issues reported may or may not be addressed.  Requests to edit and make files better can be sent to UnderKlover@gmail.com.  Want to add edit files or improve this content?  Collaborations are welcome.
